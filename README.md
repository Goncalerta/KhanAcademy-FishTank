- This program generates a Fish Tank a single random fish inside.
- The fish's turns around when he gets to the Tank Canvas.

This is a project originally made by me (Goncalerta) in [KhanAcademy](http://khanacademy.org/) back in 2015.
Almost no changes where made, only those really needed to make it able to run outside the website.
